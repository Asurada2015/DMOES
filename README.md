Multi-Objective Evolution Strategy for Dynamic Multi-objective Optimization

This paper presents a novel evolution strategy based evolutionary algorithm, named DMOES, which can efficiently and effectively solve multi-objective optimization problems in dynamic environments. Firstly, the non-dominated solutions guided immigration can facilitate the population convergence with two different strategies for the non-dominated solutions and the dominated solutions, respectively. Secondly, the simulated isotropic magnetic particles niching can guide the individuals to keep uniform distance and extent to approximate the entire Pareto front automatically. Thirdly, the fast diversity introducing reaction can further improve the population diversity without losing convergence, which is particularly important for DMOPs with both variant and invariant PS. In this way, our algorithm can track the new approximate Pareto set and approximate Pareto front as quickly as possible when the environment changes. Fourthly, DMOES can obtain a well-converged and well-diversified Pareto front with much less population size and far lower computational cost. The larger the number of individuals, the sharper the contour of the resulted approximate Pareto front will be.
